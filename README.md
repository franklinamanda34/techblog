Tech Blog
This application serves as a tech blog for users to post and save info and announcements for other users to view.
There is also a comment section that allows users to share ideas and comment on eachothers posts.
Each user will have the opportunity to create a login and have a personal dashboard with past posts.




Sources: index.js and post.js were sourced from stackoverflow to help troubleshoot somethings.


On my local machine the application displays as below:

Github is displaying my readme filed as my deployed link.



Future development: handlebars
and API development
